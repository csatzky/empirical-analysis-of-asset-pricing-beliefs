# asset-pricing-beliefs
In this study, I am deriving investment hypotheses from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (Sharpe, 1964), the Fama and French 5 Factor Model (Fama and French, 1993), and common price multiples. I empirically investigate the credibility of these investment beliefs using data from S&amp;P 500® constituents from January 2010–December 2020.
