## Abstract

Common investment beliefs result from academic research and conventional wisdom. In this study, I am deriving explicit and implicit investment hypotheses from the Capital Asset Pricing Model (Sharpe, 1964), the Fama and French 5 Factor Model (Fama and French, 1993), and common price multiples. I empirically investigate the credibility of these investment beliefs using data from S&P&nbsp;500<sup>®</sup> constituents from January 2010 to December 2020. The significance of each investment hypothesis is assessed by two methods of statistical evaluation. The goal of this research is to provide insights to asset managers in support of well-informed financial decision-making.

The hypotheses under investigation are definied a priori and include the following;

### Capital Asset Pricing Model
* _High Beta outperforms low Beta_

### Fama and French 5 Factor Model
* _Small outperforms Big_
* _High Value outperforms low Value_
* _Robust Profitability outperforms weak Profitability_
* _Conservative Investment outperforms aggressive Investment_

### Common Price Multiples
* _Low Price-to-Earnings ratio (PE) outperforms high PE_
* _Low Price-to-Revenue ratio (PR) outperforms high PR_
* _Low Price-to-Cash Flow (PCF) outperforms high PCF_

### Sharelab Limited Indicator
* _High GrowthSpread<sup>®</sup> (GS) outperforms low GS_
